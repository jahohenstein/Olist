## Structure

### Data Analysis

#### Business Development

I will first focus on the question of how Olist's sales developed over time in terms of sales volume, turnover, customer satisfaction, variety of products, variety of sellers, regional distribution ...

##### Factors driving customer satisfaction

The next step will be to check for factors that influence customer satisfaction (i.e. review scores). The idea is to identify whether certain sellers are responsible for the majority of bad reviews, whether a late delivery annoys customers or whether some product categories are just of bad quality.

### Business implications







### Further ideas for later implementation
- sales prediction
- text analysis to check for reasons for bad reviews
